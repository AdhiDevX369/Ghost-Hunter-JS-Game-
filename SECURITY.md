Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in Ghost Hunter, please email me at Dammikaekanayaka1980@gmail.com. I take all security vulnerabilities very seriously and will respond to your email as soon as possible.
<ul>
When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following details:

  <li>Steps to reproduce the vulnerability</li>
  <li>Any additional information that could help me reproduce and fix the vulnerability</li>
  <li>Responsible Disclosure</li>
  </ul>
<strong>I kindly request that you practice responsible disclosure when reporting any vulnerabilities to me. This means that you:</strong>

Only test for vulnerabilities on systems that you own or have permission to test
Do not exploit any vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to prove that a vulnerability exists
Do not share any sensitive data obtained during your testing
Provide me with reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before sharing any information about it with others
